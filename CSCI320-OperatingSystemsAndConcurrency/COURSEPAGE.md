# [CSCI 320: Operating Systems and Concurrency](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci320/)

## Overview
A study of the three major concepts of a modern operating systems: virtualization, concurrency and persistence. 
Topics include:
  - The memory hierarchy (including caching and virtual memory)
  - Memory managment
  - Processes
  - Processor scheduling
  - Address spaces 
  - Threads
  - The critical section problem 
  - Locks
  - Sockets 
  - File systems
  - System performance analysis

## Learning Goals
Upon completing this course, our goal is for you to be able to:
Describe how an operating system mediates interaction with:
  - CPU and RAM by virtualizing those resources by means of the process abstraction.
  - Persistent memory (hard disk, Flash memory) through the file system abstraction.
  - The Internet through the TCP socket abstraction.
Write useful programs that:
  - Interact directly with the CPU, RAM, keyboard, and monitor on behalf of a user.
  - Operate concurrently without errors.
  - Empirically analyze the performance of operating system components. 
  - Address cybersecurity issues that arise in these contexts.
