While I did not take all of the offerings due to scheduling conflicts, I have been fortunate that they are offered as open source courses. 
This repository was made to have a complete source of all my school work.
It is currently actively being worked on as a way for me to remain sharp, write better code compared to when I first started out, and to explore in greater detail topics that I was unable to while in school due to constaints. 
Very much under construction, enjoy.
